## Project 5: Text Classification with Deep Learning - Part 2 (LA5)
## Overview
In this second installment of our deep learning series for text classification, we delve into more complex models and techniques. This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and advanced Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) architectures for classifying restaurant reviews. The aim is to achieve higher accuracy and efficiency in understanding customer sentiments and topics from textual feedback.

## Objectives
- To implement advanced deep learning models for text classification.
- To compare the performance of CNNs and advanced RNNs in processing textual data.
- To enhance model performance with techniques like word embeddings and dropout for regularization.
## Methodology
The project's approach includes several key components:

- Advanced Preprocessing: Utilizing techniques like word embeddings to represent text data, providing richer input for deep learning models.
- Model Architecture: Building and tuning CNN and advanced RNN models, including variations like GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) networks, to classify text data effectively.
- Performance Evaluation: Assessing the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, using a hold-out test set to gauge their real-world applicability.
## Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset of restaurant reviews, annotated with sentiments or specific aspects related to the dining experience. This rich dataset allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance in classifying diverse types of feedback.

## Findings
This project uncovers the strengths and limitations of using CNNs and advanced RNNs for text classification. It provides insights into how different architectures and preprocessing techniques impact the models' ability to generalize from the training data to unseen reviews.
## Conclusion
This project identified key themes in customer feedback, including popular cuisines (e.g., ramen, Indian, sushi), service quality, COVID-19 safety measures, and the dining atmosphere. Key findings suggest that:

- Specialty dishes and diverse menu options are highly valued.
- Positive service experiences significantly impact customer satisfaction.
- Effective communication and implementation of COVID-19 precautions are crucial for customer trust.
- The ambiance and beverage selections enhance the dining experience.
By focusing on these areas, restaurants can improve customer satisfaction, adapt to changing preferences, and maintain a competitive edge in the market.
