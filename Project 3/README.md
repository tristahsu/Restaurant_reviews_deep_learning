## Project 3: Topic Modeling with LDA (LA3)
## Overview
This project dives into the world of topic modeling, employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover the underlying themes within a dataset of restaurant reviews. The objective is to extract meaningful topics that represent the main subjects of discussion in the reviews, providing insights into customer interests and concerns.

## Objectives
- To understand and implement LDA for topic modeling.
- To identify and interpret the main topics present in restaurant reviews.
- To demonstrate the preprocessing steps required for effective topic modeling.
## Methodology
The project utilizes the LDA model to perform topic modeling on textual data. It involves several key steps:
- Data Preprocessing: Preparing the text data through tokenization, stop words removal, and other cleaning processes.
- Feature Extraction: Converting the text data into a document-term matrix, which is required for LDA modeling.
- LDA Modeling: Applying the LDA algorithm to extract topics from the dataset.
- Topic Interpretation: Analyzing the output of the LDA model to interpret and label the topics discovered.
## Data Source
The dataset consists of restaurant reviews, providing a rich source of textual data for topic modeling. The reviews cover various aspects of dining experiences, making them suitable for extracting diverse topics.

## Findings
This project's findings offer a glimpse into the common themes discussed in restaurant reviews, such as food quality, service experience, ambiance, and price. The LDA model's ability to categorize these themes into distinct topics helps in understanding customer priorities and areas for improvement.
## Conclusion
The first topic appears to cover aspects like crowd levels, food ingredients, and the overall restaurant atmosphere. It might capture reviews discussing the busy environment, specific dishes, and the overall vibe. The second topic revolves around business-related elements, including the overall environment, changes, and the variety of items available such as beans and banana. It likely touches on aspects related to the restaurant's offerings and flexibility. The third topic is a bit more complex, suggesting an emphasis on entertainment or unique experiences within the restaurant. Words like "beats," "cheers," and "accompanying" hint at a lively atmosphere, possibly with cultural influences. The reviews vary in sentiment, with one expressing negative sentiments linked to the pandemic, another providing a positive outlook on a soft opening, and others praising specific restaurants for their quality service and diverse offerings. Yet, a negative experience during July at a hotel casino stands out, contrasting with a positive surprise during a town visit, highlighting well-seasoned burgers and friendly service.
