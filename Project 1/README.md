## Project 1: Text Processing Techniques (LA1)
## Overview
This project serves as an introduction to the foundational text processing techniques essential for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It aims to equip users with the knowledge and tools needed to prepare text data for analysis, covering a range of preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and the removal of stop words.

## Objectives
- To understand and implement basic text processing methods.
- To prepare text data for further NLP and machine learning tasks.
- To demonstrate the impact of preprocessing on the quality of data analysis.
## Methodology
The project uses Python along with libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to demonstrate various text processing techniques. Each section of the notebook introduces a different preprocessing step, explains its significance, and provides code examples for implementation.

## Key Techniques 
- Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
- Stemming: Reducing words to their base or root form.
- Lemmatization: Converting words to their lemma or dictionary form.
- Removing Stop Words: Eliminating common words that add little value to the analysis.
## Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset of restaurant reviews to demonstrate text processing. This dataset includes a collection of textual feedback from customers, providing a rich source for exploring different preprocessing techniques.

## Findings
The preprocessing of text data significantly enhances the performance of NLP models by removing noise and reducing complexity. This project illustrates how each step in text processing contributes to the clarity and efficiency of data analysis.
## Conclusion
In 1-star reviews, people often mention places like Tucson, expressing dissatisfaction with food or service, using words like "bad" and "worst." Verbs like "go" and "get" are common, indicating negative experiences. Adjectives such as "good" and "great" are used to describe service and food. Key nouns include "order," "food," and "time," reflecting disappointment in various aspects. In contrast, 5-star reviews highlight positive experiences in Tucson with words like "great" and "best." Verbs like "love" and "recommend" signify positive sentiments. Adjectives such as "delicious" and "fresh" describe food, emphasizing positive aspects. Key nouns include "food," "place," and "order," showcasing delightful experiences. A good restaurant experience involves exceptional service, tasty food, and a welcoming atmosphere.
